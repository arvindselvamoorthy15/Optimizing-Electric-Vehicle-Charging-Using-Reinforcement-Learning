# Optimizing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project leverages reinforcement learning to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging schedules. By analyzing historical charging data, weather, and traffic patterns, the model minimizes energy costs and balances grid loads. It efficiently determines the best times to charge EVs, ensuring grid stability and reducing energy expenses.

## Overview
This project applies reinforcement learning to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging schedules. The model predicts optimal charging times based on historical data, weather conditions, and traffic patterns to minimize energy costs and balance grid loads.
